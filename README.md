# Spam Detection Using SVM
This repository houses the code and data for an email spam identifier utilizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. By analyzing email content and metadata, we aim to effectively distinguish genuine messages from unsolicited advertisements and malicious attempts.
Key Features:

Powerful SVM classifier: Leverages the robust capabilities of SVMs for accurate spam detection.
Feature engineering: Prepares email data by extracting relevant features like keywords, sender information, and attachments.
Model training and evaluation: Optimizes the SVM model based on historical data and measures its performance on unseen emails.
Customizable filtering: Adapt the model to your specific needs by adjusting parameters and incorporating personalized rules.
